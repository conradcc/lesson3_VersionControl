            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The original idea behind Git began when a software called Linux kernel decided to use a DVCS called BitKeeper. However, the relationship between the two turned sour after about three years and due to this the tool was forced to start charging to use it services. With this change of events the Linux community invented their own tool to replace BitKeeper, this lead to the creation of Git. Git was created with these goals in mind: speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development, full distribution, and the ability to handle large projects. The creation of Git was successful and has done everything is was created to do.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free service that is a VCS, version control system, that was created to be able to manage small to large projects well. The reason Git stands apart from any other VCS is because Git thinks about its data differently. Git uses what is called a delta-based version control which thinks of stored data as a set of files and that they can change over time. Another great quality of Git is that it only really needs local files in order to operate and does not have to access another device on a network, this also allows the speed of Git to be faster than if it had to access data from a non-local file.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways to create a Git Repository either take a local directory and turn it into a Git repository or you can clone a previous created Git repository. For example, for lesson three we had to create a new Git repository and then link it to our Cloud9 account. This action would be an example of the first option in creating a Git repository. Creating a new Git repository is actually marginally easy to do, the only problem I ran into for the project is when I tried to enter the second line of code officially connecting Git and Cloud9. I kept getting an error message and realized when I went back that the Repository name was capitalized and the cloud9 name was not so it wouldn’t link until I changed it.p>

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is one main repository where all the files for a project are stored. So a Versioning Control System (VCS) is a system that logs any changes in the files and records things such as time and date of change and what information was changed in the data files. VCS provides a backup for the files so the information will be saved. Repositories are relevant to VCS because they are created to organize the data and information stored in VCS’s. Two types of repositories are Remote or Local. Remote repositories are stored on a shared server while a Local Repository is stored on a local machine or device on the same network. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are dozens of useful Git commands. Some of the basic Git commands are ones used in the assignment for lesson three. These commands include: git init, git add, git commit. These commands were used in order to create a local repository (git int), add files and folders to the directory (git add), and then commit the files to the local repository using ‘git commit’. These three commands are some of the most basic commands used in Git because they perform the base functions for the creation of and production the files in order to create a Repository.</p>
